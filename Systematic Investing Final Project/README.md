# Systematic Investing Final Project
Final Project for NYU Robo Advisors and Systematic Investing course. 

In this project we aim to predict and trade off of Sector ETFs using fundamental analysis in a variety of strategies
and feature engineering techniques with promising results.

Included is Optimizer.py, the algortihm that optimizes the 3 fundamental thresholds to trade with for each individual Sector.
This was done on past data to avoid overfitting, using the optimized thresholds as a basis for the backtesting period.
